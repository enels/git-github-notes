git status -s
gives you a more concise version of the status command
A - files that on the staged area
M - files that have been modified
?? - files that are not been tracked

git diff
allows you view changes that have been made(the way it is in your working directory) but not yet staged
This command displays:

    the files that have been modified
    the location of the lines that have been added/removed
    the actual changes that have been made
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff

git diff --staged
allows you to view changes that are on the staging area that are yet to be committed

git diff --cached
displays what have been staged so far (--staged and --cached are synonyms)

git difftool
displays the unstaged changes with the stagged ones using a GUI tool
git difftool --tool=emerge
chooses the GUI tool to use
git difftool --tool-help
for help info on how to use it

git rm
Removes or deletes a file from your tracked files i.e from your staging area. After doing this you have to commit the changes.
NB: Any file that has been added to the staging area when removed using git rm cannot be recovered so for that reason
git forces you to use the -f option to prevent you from removing the staged files.

git rm --cached "file name"
Removes or deletes a file from your staging area but keeps it in your working tree. This particularly use if you forgot to add a file to the
gitignore file but already staged it. Files, directories and file-glob pattern can be passed to the command.

git log
Displays all the git commit and their commit SHA-1, author, date, commit message and file

git log -w
ignores white spaces

git log --oneline
lists one command per line, shows the first 7 characters of the commit's SHA and lastly shows commit's message

git log --stat
lists the files that have been changed in the commit, as well as the number of lines that have been added or deleted(stat for statistics).
also it list the number of files that have been modified/deleted

git log --patch or -p
This can be used to display the actual changes that has been made to a file.
The description of each line that is printed out is shown below:

    üîµ - the file that is being displayed
    üî∂ - the hash of the first version of the file and the hash of the second version of the file
        not usually important, so it's safe to ignore
    ‚ù§Ô∏è - the old version and current version of the file
    üîç - the lines where the file is added and how many lines there are
        -15,83 indicates that the old version (represented by the -) started at line 15 and that the file had 83 lines
        +15,85 indicates that the current version (represented by the +) starts at line 15 and that there are now 85 lines...these 85 lines are shown in the patch below
    ‚úèÔ∏è - the actual changes made in the commit
        lines that are red and start with a minus (-) were in the original version of the file but have been removed by the commit
        lines that are green and start with a plus (+) are new lines that have been added in the commit 
In summary
- it displays the files that have been modified
- it displays the location of the lines that have been added/removed
- it displays the actual changes that have been made.
A commit hash can be added to this command
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#_generating_patches_with_p

git show
This also shows a specific commit like. This only shows the most recent commit

git show "commit hash"
The git show command will show only one commit. So don't get alarmed when you can't find any other commits - it only shows one. The output of the git show command is exactly the same as the git log -p command. So by default, git show displays:

    the commit
    the author
    the date
    the commit message
    the patch information

However, git show can be combined with most of the other flags we've looked at:

    --stat - to show the how many files were changed and the number of lines that were added/removed
    -p or --patch - this the default, but if --stat is used, the patch won't display, so pass -p to add it again
    -w - to ignore changes to whitespace

git tag -a v1.0
git tag is used for labelling or tagginng the current version of the project you are working on. git tag -a v1.0 is called an annotated tagging.
nnotated tags are recommended because they include a lot of extra information such as:

    the person who made the tag
    the date the tag was made
    a message for the tag
without the -a flag, it's non-annotated
git tag
A tag is a permanent pointer to a commit in a repository
for verifying taggings. lists out the various tags 

git log --decorate
this include more info to the log output e.g the tag. This is almost equivalent to git log these days.

git tag -d v1.0
Deletes a tag.

git tag -a v1.0 "commit hash"
Adds a tag to a past commit.

git branch
This is used to interact with Git's branches
It can be used to:

    list all branch names in the repository
    create new branches
    delete branches
The command git branch lists out the branches in the repository

git branch sidebar
To create a branch, all you have to do is use git branch and provide it the name of the branch you want it to create.

git checkout 'branch to switch to'
git checkout sidebar
This is used to switch between branches
It's important to understand how this command works. Running this command will:

    remove all files and directories from the Working Directory that Git is tracking
        (files that Git tracks are stored in the repository, so nothing is lost)
    go into the repository and pull out all of the files and directories of the commit that the branch points to 

git branch -d 'branch to delete'
git branch -d sidebar
This deletes a branch.
NB: You can't delete a branch you are currently on. So to delete a branch e.g the sidebar, you must switch to another branch e.g the master or create and switch to a new branch.

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging
https://learngitbranching.js.org/
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches

NB: When changes are made to a file under a branch and a commit to that file is made on another branch, git will show you the commit on the branch that it was made not the branch that the changes were made.

git checkout -b 'new branch name' 'commit to start from'
git checkout -b footer master
creates a branch called footer from the commit that master is pointing to and then checks out to the newly created branch.

git log --oneline --graph --all
Displays all branches at once.

Merging
There are 2 types of merging - normal merge and fast-forward merge. Remember that merge create a commit. Make sure you are in the branch you want to commit the merge to.
git merge <name-of-branch-to-merge-in>
NB: If you mistakenly merged to the wrong branch, to undo changes use:
git reset --hard HEAD^
The ^ sign is known as a "Relative Commit Refefence"

When a merge happens, Git will:

    look at the branches that it's going to merge
    look back along the branch's history to find a single commit that both branches have in their commit history
    combine the lines of code that were changed on the separate branches together
    makes a commit to record the merge
Note again, When we merge, we're merging some other branch into the current (checked-out) branch. We're not merging two branches into a new branch. We're not merging the current branch into the other branch.

Note that duing a divergent merge, a commit is usually made and you're prompted to type in a commit message but, it's usually just adviceable to use the default message

Merge Conflict
Git tracks lines in files. A merge conflict will happen when the exact same line(s) are changed in separate branches. A merge conflict occurs when Git isn't sure which line(s) you want to use from the branches that are being merged.
To resolve a merge conflict do the following:

    locate and remove all lines with merge conflict indicators
    determine what to keep
    save the file(s)
    stage the file(s)
    make a commit
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_how_conflicts_are_presented
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#Basic-Merge-Conflicts 

Changing the last commit
git commit --amend
This helps you to change the last commit message from a typo or misspelling or something. You can also use it to add forgotten files to a commit.

Reverting a commit
When you tell Git to revert a specific commit, Git takes the changes that were made in commit and does the exact opposite of them. It can be done using:
git revert <SHA-of-commit-to-reset>
This command:

    will undo the changes that were made by the provided commit
    creates a new commit to record the change

https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert

Resetting a commit
Resetting a commit erease the commit and it's content from the repository. To alleviate this stress a bit, Git does keep track of everything for about 30 days before it completely deletes anything. To access this content, you will use the command git reflog.

Relative commit references
There are special characters called "Ancestry References" that we can use to tell Git about these relative references. Those characters are:

    ^ ‚Äì indicates the parent commit
    ~ ‚Äì indicates the first parent commit

Here's how we can refer to previous commits:

    the parent commit ‚Äì the following indicate the parent commit of the current commit
        HEAD^
        HEAD~
        HEAD~1
    the grandparent commit ‚Äì the following indicate the grandparent commit of the current commit
        HEAD^^
        HEAD~2
    the great-grandparent commit ‚Äì the following indicate the great-grandparent commit of the current commit
        HEAD^^^
        HEAD~3
HEAD^^^2 grandparent(HEAD^^) second parent(^2)
To illustrate it use the below git log result
* 9ec05ca (HEAD -> master) Revert "Set page heading to "Quests & Crusades""
* db7e87a Set page heading to "Quests & Crusades"
*   796ddb0 Merge branch 'heading-update'
|\  
| * 4c9749e (heading-update) Set page heading to "Crusade"
* | 0c5975a Set page heading to "Quest"
|/  
*   1a56a81 Merge branch 'sidebar'
|\  
| * f69811c (sidebar) Update sidebar with favorite movie
| * e6c65a6 Add new sidebar content
* | e014d91 (footer) Add links to social media
* | 209752a Improve site heading for SEO
* | 3772ab1 Set background color for page
|/  
* 5bfe5e7 Add starting HTML structure
* 6fa5f34 Add .gitignore file
* a879849 Add header to blog
* 94de470 Initial commit


    HEAD^ is the db7e87a commit
    HEAD~1 is also the db7e87a commit
    HEAD^^ is the 796ddb0 commit
    HEAD~2 is also the 796ddb0 commit
    HEAD^^^ is the 0c5975a commit
    HEAD~3 is also the 0c5975a commit
    HEAD^^^2 is the 4c9749e commit (this is the grandparent's (HEAD^^) second parent (^2))
The git reset command
git reset <reference-to-commit>
It can be used to:

    move the HEAD and current branch pointer to the referenced commit
    erase commits
    move committed changes to the staging index
    unstage committed changes

Git reset flag
The way that Git determines if it erases, stages previously committed changes, or unstages previously committed changes is by the flag that's used. The flags are:

    --mixed
    --soft
    --hard
git reset --mixed <reference-to-commit> is the default when no flag is indicated. The commit is sent to the working directory
git reset --soft moves it to the staging area.
git reset --hard moves the commit to the trash

It's always a good practice to create a backup before isuing the git --reset command. To do it simply create a branch and call it backup
git branch backup
To revert back to the previous one, say from the master branch (whose commit it was point to was deleted), simply just remove uncommitted changes and then merge in the backup branch.
The merging will move (fast-forwrad) the master branch to the backup branch.
NB: To remove uncommitted changes from the working directory use
git checkout -- filename
